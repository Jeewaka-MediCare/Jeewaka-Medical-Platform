## Architecture review, questions, and next steps

Summary:
- Roles: Doctor, Patient, Admin.
- Features: signup/signin, doctor listings and profiles, booking and payments, teleconsultations (videosdk), medical records, ratings, doctor sessions/pricing, calendars, admin verification and analytics.
- Current repo state: backend and frontend folders, mobile app present. A `dump/` folder contains BSON and JSON exports from the `medAI` database (collections: doctors, sessions, patients, users, hospitals, ratings).

Questions to evaluate progress and architecture (answer briefly):
1. Do you use Firebase Auth (I noticed `config/fireBaseAdmin.js`) or a custom auth (JWT/session)?
2. How is role-based access enforced (middleware, role field, other)?
3. Which client is priority: `frontend/` (web) or `Mobile_App/` (Expo)?
4. Where will you host backend/frontend (Docker Compose, Vercel, AWS, etc.)? Is the provided `docker-compose.yml` in active use?
5. Is MongoDB Atlas the production DB? Any migration/versioning in place?
6. Are secrets intended to live in env vars/secret manager? (I saw a URI in scripts earlier.)
7. Any CI/tests currently configured? Want GitHub Actions?
8. How is teleconsultation integrated (videosdk: client-only or server-side signaling)?
9. Are you using Mongoose or native driver? Are schemas validated at app or DB level?
10. Which deliverables are highest priority this sprint (mobile pages, secure deploy, tests, docs)?

Project responses (provided):
1. Auth: jwt sessions
2. RBAC: enforced via middleware
3. Client priority: web (`frontend/`)
4. Hosting: backend currently on EC2 (Docker Compose not actively required for current EC2 deploy)
5. Database: MongoDB Atlas is production
6. Secrets: backend uses env (there is an env in backend)
7. CI/tests: none presently configured (no GitHub Actions)
8. Teleconsultation: videosdk client-only (server-side signaling not used)
9. DB driver / validation: app-level validation (Mongoose or similar at app level)
10. Sprint priority: pages (frontend)

Reprioritized high-level todo list (end-to-end focused):
1. Build a demoable end-to-end web flow: login → doctor list → doctor profile → booking → confirmation → (optional) join teleconsult. (Highest)
2. Implement missing backend endpoints required by the flow (auth/login, booking endpoint). (High)
3. Create seed/demo data and a restore script so devs can reproduce the flows locally from `dump/`. (High)
4. Implement frontend pages and state for the booking flow in `frontend/`. (High)
5. Add lightweight E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress) that exercise the full flow. (High)
6. After E2E works reliably, add CI to run lint/test/E2E in PRs. (Medium)
7. Defer security/deployment hardening (env/secret audits, monitoring) until after the E2E demo is stable—schedule as a follow-up. (Low)

Atomic tasks (end-to-end, small & actionable):
- Task 1 — Backend: Implement POST `/api/auth/login` that returns a JWT session cookie (30–60m)
- Task 2 — Backend: Implement GET `/api/doctor` (with optional search) returning doctors (30–60m)
- Task 3 — Backend: Implement GET `/api/doctor/:id` and GET `/api/session?doctorId=` (45–90m)
- Task 4 — Backend: Implement booking endpoint POST `/api/session/:sessionId/book` or POST `/api/bookings` that marks a timeslot as booked (45–120m)
- Task 5 — Frontend: Implement Login page and session handling in `frontend` (45–90m)
- Task 6 — Frontend: Implement Doctor list page and cards, wired to `/api/doctor` (45–90m)
- Task 7 — Frontend: Implement Doctor profile page with availability and booking modal (1–2h)
- Task 8 — Frontend: Implement Booking confirmation page and a "Join Session" stub that opens the videosdk page (30–60m)
- Task 9 — Dev tooling: Add `scripts/restore-db.ps1` to load the BSON archive or a `seed.js` to insert minimal demo data (30–45m)
- Task 10 — Tests: Add one Playwright E2E test that runs login → list → book → confirmation (1–3h)

Suggested immediate next action:
- Start with Task 1 (auth/login endpoint) and Task 5 (frontend login wiring) so the rest of the flow can be tested behind an authenticated session. I can implement Task 1 now — confirm and I'll proceed.

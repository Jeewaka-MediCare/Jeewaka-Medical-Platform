# Mobile App Backend Integration Update

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to integrate the mobile app with the new backend authentication, authorization, payment, and medical recording systems.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Authentication System Updates

#### Updated Files:
- `services/api.js` - Added automatic Firebase token injection
- `store/authStore.js` - Enhanced with Firebase auth state listener
- `app/login.jsx` - Updated to use new role-based authentication
- `app/register.jsx` - Updated role setting for new backend
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Added proper auth initialization

#### Key Improvements:
- **Automatic Token Management**: API requests now automatically include Firebase Bearer tokens
- **Real-time Auth State**: Firebase auth state changes are monitored and synced
- **Role-based Navigation**: Users are redirected based on their assigned roles
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and auth failure handling

### 2. Payment System Updates

#### Updated Files:
- `services/paymentService.js` - Updated for new Stripe webhook flow
- `services/apiHelpers.js` - New authenticated API helper methods

#### Key Improvements:
- **Authentication Required**: Payment creation now requires user authentication
- **Server-side Security**: Backend validates patient identity using Firebase UID
- **Webhook Integration**: Appointment booking handled automatically via Stripe webhooks
- **Simplified Flow**: Removed complex retry logic since booking is handled server-side

### 3. API Integration Enhancements

#### New Files:
- `services/apiHelpers.js` - Centralized authenticated API methods
- `services/errorHandler.js` - Comprehensive error handling utilities
- `services/medicalRecordsService.js` - Medical records API integration

#### Key Features:
- **Centralized Auth**: All authenticated requests go through common helpers
- **Error Standardization**: Consistent error handling across the app
- **Medical Records**: Full integration with new medical records system
- **Role-based Access**: Proper authorization checks for different user types

## Security Improvements

### 1. Token Security
- Firebase tokens automatically added to all authenticated requests
- Tokens are refreshed automatically when needed
- Expired tokens trigger re-authentication flow

### 2. Payment Security
- Patient identity verified server-side using Firebase UID
- No client-side patient ID trusted for payments
- Comprehensive audit trail for all payment activities

### 3. Authorization
- Role-based access control enforced at API level
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access
- Clear separation between public and authenticated endpoints

## Backend Compatibility

### Authentication Endpoints
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/role` - Set user role (public)
- ✅ `GET /api/auth/users/:uid/role` - Get user role (authenticated)
- ✅ `PUT /api/auth/users/:uid/role` - Update role (admin only)

### Payment Endpoints
- ✅ `POST /api/payments/create-intent` - Create payment (authenticated)
- ✅ `POST /api/payments/webhook` - Stripe webhook (signature verified)

### User Endpoints
- ✅ `GET /api/patient/uuid/:uuid` - Get patient by Firebase UID
- ✅ `GET /api/doctor/uuid/:uuid` - Get doctor by Firebase UID
- ✅ `POST /api/patient/` - Create patient profile
- ✅ `POST /api/doctor/` - Create doctor profile

### Medical Records Endpoints
- ✅ `GET /api/records/patient/:patientId` - Get patient records (authenticated)
- ✅ `POST /api/records` - Create record (doctor only)
- ✅ `PUT /api/records/:id` - Update record (authorized users)
- ✅ `DELETE /api/records/:id` - Soft delete record (authorized users)

## Error Handling Improvements

### Authentication Errors
- 401: Session expired → Automatic logout prompt
- 403: Insufficient permissions → Clear error message
- Firebase errors → User-friendly messages

### Payment Errors
- Stripe configuration issues → Helpful setup messages
- Authentication required → Login prompt
- Payment failures → Retry suggestions

### Network Errors
- Connection issues → Retry suggestions
- Server errors → Fallback options
- Timeout errors → User guidance

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
1. All API calls now automatically include authentication headers
2. Error handling should use the new `errorHandler` service
3. Medical records should use the new `medicalRecordsService`
4. Payment flows are simplified due to webhook automation

### For Testers
1. Ensure Firebase authentication is properly configured
2. Test role-based navigation (patient → home, doctor → appointments)
3. Verify payment flow with proper authentication
4. Test error scenarios (network issues, auth failures)

### Environment Variables Required
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://your-backend-url:5000
EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_key
```

## Backward Compatibility

### Maintained Features
- All existing UI components work unchanged
- User registration and login flows preserved
- Payment checkout process remains the same
- Session booking interface unchanged

### Removed Dependencies
- Old booking retry logic (now handled by webhooks)
- Client-side payment confirmation complexity
- Manual token management

## Testing Checklist

### Authentication
- [ ] User registration with patient role
- [ ] User registration with doctor role
- [ ] User login with different roles
- [ ] Token refresh on app resume
- [ ] Logout functionality

### Payments
- [ ] Payment intent creation with authentication
- [ ] Successful payment processing
- [ ] Webhook-based appointment booking
- [ ] Payment error handling

### API Integration
- [ ] Authenticated API calls
- [ ] Error handling for 401/403 responses
- [ ] Medical records access
- [ ] Role-based endpoint access

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Biometric Authentication**: Add face/fingerprint login
2. **Offline Support**: Cache medical records for offline viewing
3. **Push Notifications**: Real-time appointment updates
4. **Multi-language Support**: Localized error messages
5. **Advanced Security**: Certificate pinning for API calls

### Medical Records Features
1. **Document Upload**: Support for medical document attachments
2. **Record Sharing**: Secure sharing between doctors
3. **Version History**: View record change history
4. **Search Functionality**: Advanced record search and filtering

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Authentication required" errors**: Check Firebase configuration
2. **Payment creation fails**: Verify Stripe keys and user authentication
3. **Role not found**: Ensure role was set during registration
4. **API connection issues**: Check backend URL and network connectivity

### Debug Tips
1. Check browser/app console for detailed error logs
2. Verify Firebase token in request headers
3. Test backend endpoints directly with Postman
4. Monitor network requests in developer tools

## Conclusion

The mobile app has been successfully updated to work with the new backend architecture. The changes maintain backward compatibility while adding robust authentication, secure payments, and comprehensive medical record management. The new error handling and API integration provide a more reliable and user-friendly experience.

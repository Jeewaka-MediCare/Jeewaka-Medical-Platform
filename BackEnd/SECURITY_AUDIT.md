# Backend API Security Audit

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Branch:** 7-creating-medical-record-management-system  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES FOUND

---

## Executive Summary

**Only 2 out of 11 route modules** are properly secured with authentication middleware. The majority of the backend API endpoints are **completely unprotected**, allowing anyone to:
- Access patient medical records
- Modify doctor profiles
- Delete hospital data
- Access admin functions
- View all user data
- Manipulate appointments and sessions

**Risk Level:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**

---

## Route Security Status

### ‚úÖ **SECURED Routes** (2/11)

#### 1. Medical Records (`/api/medical-records/*`)
- ‚úÖ All endpoints use `authMiddleware`
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control implemented
- ‚úÖ Audit logging enabled
- Status: **FULLY SECURED**

#### 2. Auth Routes (`/api/auth/*`)
- ‚úÖ Admin endpoints protected with `authMiddleware` + `requireRole(['admin'])`
- ‚úÖ Public registration endpoint properly limited
- Status: **PROPERLY SECURED**

---

### üî¥ **UNSECURED Routes** (9/11)

#### 1. Patient Routes (`/api/patient/*`) - ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH RISK
```javascript
GET    /api/patient                        ‚ùå NO AUTH - Anyone can list all patients
GET    /api/patient/:patientId/appointments ‚ùå NO AUTH - Anyone can see patient appointments
POST   /api/patient                        ‚ùå NO AUTH - Anyone can create fake patients
GET    /api/patient/:id                    ‚ùå NO AUTH - Anyone can view patient details
GET    /api/patient/uuid/:uuid             ‚ùå NO AUTH - Anyone can lookup patients by UUID
PUT    /api/patient/:id                    ‚ùå NO AUTH - Anyone can modify patient data
DELETE /api/patient/:id                    ‚ùå NO AUTH - Anyone can delete patients
```
**Risk:** Anyone can access all patient information, including appointments, personal data, and medical history.

**Risk:** While GET requests might be acceptable for public search, POST/PUT/DELETE should be restricted.

---

#### 3. Session/Appointment Routes (`/api/session/*`) - ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RISK
```javascript
POST   /api/session                        ‚ùå NO AUTH - Anyone can create sessions

```javascript
GET    /api/doctorCard                     ‚ùå NO AUTH - Public cards (acceptable)
GET    /api/doctorCard/:doctorId           ‚ùå NO AUTH - Public card (acceptable)

---

## Summary by Risk Level

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Immediate Action Required)
1. **Admin Routes** - Complete exposure of admin management
2. **Doctor Verification** - Anyone can approve doctor credentials
3. **Session/Appointments** - Complete control over appointment system
4. **Patient Routes** - Full access to patient medical data

### üü† HIGH (High Priority)
1. **Doctor Routes** - POST/PUT/DELETE need protection
2. **Payments** - Payment intent creation needs auth

### üü° MEDIUM (Should Fix)
1. **Hospital Routes** - POST/PUT/DELETE need protection
2. **Ratings** - POST needs auth to prevent spam

### üü¢ LOW (Nice to Have)
1. **Doctor Cards** - Already public by design
2. **Doctor Search** - Public search is intentional

---

## Recommended Security Model

### Public Routes (No Auth Required)
```javascript
// Doctor search and profiles (public directory)
GET /api/doctor
GET /api/doctor/search
GET /api/doctor/:id
GET /api/doctor/filter-options

// Hospital directory (public information)
GET /api/hospital
GET /api/hospital/:hospitalId

// Doctor cards (public profiles)
GET /api/doctorCard
GET /api/doctorCard/:doctorId

// Ratings (public reviews)
GET /api/ratings/doctor/:doctorId
GET /api/ratings/doctor/:doctorId/average

// Auth (registration only)
POST /api/auth/role

// Payments webhook (Stripe signature verification)
POST /api/payments/webhook
```

### Authenticated Routes (Any logged-in user)
```javascript
// Current user's data only
GET /api/patient/:id  (if :id === req.user._id)
PUT /api/patient/:id  (if :id === req.user._id)
GET /api/patient/:patientId/appointments (if patient owns appointments)

// Doctors updating their own profiles
GET /api/doctor/:id  (if :id === req.user._id)
PUT /api/doctor/:id  (if :id === req.user._id)

// Authenticated ratings
POST /api/ratings

// Payment intents
POST /api/payments/create-intent

// Booking appointments
POST /api/session/:sessionId/book
```

### Doctor-Only Routes
```javascript
// Doctor session management
POST /api/session
GET /api/session/doctor/:doctorId (own sessions)
PATCH /api/session/:sessionId (own sessions)
DELETE /api/session/:sessionId (own sessions)
POST /api/session/:sessionId/timeslot
PUT /api/session/:sessionId/timeslot/:slotIndex
DELETE /api/session/:sessionId/timeslot/:slotIndex

// Doctor verification submission
POST /api/admin-verification (doctors can submit their own)
```

### Admin-Only Routes
```javascript
// All admin management
POST /api/admin
GET /api/admin
PUT /api/admin/:id
DELETE /api/admin/:id

// Hospital management
POST /api/hospital
PUT /api/hospital/:hospitalId
DELETE /api/hospital/:hospitalId

// Doctor verification approval
GET /api/admin-verification
PUT /api/admin-verification/:doctorId

// Doctor account management
POST /api/doctor (admin creates verified doctors)
DELETE /api/doctor/:id

// Patient management (admin support)
GET /api/patient (list all)
DELETE /api/patient/:id (account removal)

// User role management
PUT /api/auth/users/:uid/role
```

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Security (Do Immediately)
1. ‚úÖ Secure medical records routes (**COMPLETED**)
2. ‚úÖ Secure auth routes (**COMPLETED**)
3. üî≤ Secure admin routes
4. üî≤ Secure doctor verification routes
5. üî≤ Secure session/appointment routes
6. üî≤ Secure patient routes (at least the write operations)

### Phase 2: High Priority
1. üî≤ Secure doctor POST/PUT/DELETE routes
2. üî≤ Secure payment intent creation
3. üî≤ Add owner-based access control (users can only access their own data)

### Phase 3: Improvements
1. üî≤ Secure hospital POST/PUT/DELETE routes
2. üî≤ Secure ratings POST route
3. üî≤ Add rate limiting to public endpoints
4. üî≤ Add request logging and monitoring

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Secure all routes immediately** (recommended)
2. **Create a phased implementation plan**
3. **Focus on specific high-risk routes first**
4. **Generate updated route files with proper authentication**

**Recommendation:** Implement Phase 1 immediately before deploying to production. The current state poses significant security risks.
